        <h2>Global Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Obesity has become one of the most pressing global health challenges of the 21st century. 
          Since 1980, worldwide obesity rates have more than doubled, affecting both developed and 
          developing nations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 650 million adults 
          were classified as obese in 2022 which represents nearly <strong>16% of the global population</strong>. 
          The rise of obesity is strongly linked to changes in diet, lifestyles, and urbanisation. 
          While obesity was once considered a problem only in high-income countries, it is now increasingly 
          prevalent in low and middle income nations as well.

          <h3>Insights</h3>
           <p>In 2022, <strong>Egypt</strong> recorded the <strong>highest adult obesity rate at 57.1%</strong>, 
            followed by nations in the <strong>Americas</strong> and <strong>Western Pacific</strong> regions. 
            Countries across <strong>Africa</strong> and <strong>South-East Asia</strong> still show comparatively 
            lower obesity rates but have experienced steady increases over time. 
            This global map highlights the spatial inequality and ongoing rise of obesity worldwide.</p>

        <div class="trend-text">
          <h3>Insights</h3>
          <p>Obesity rates have increased consistently across all regions over the past
            four decades. Europe and the Americas lead with the highest averages, while
            regions like Africa and South-East Asia show steady but slower growth.
            The dropdown filter helps highlight regional differences in this global trend.</p>

          <p>These changes reflect broader shifts in diet, lifestyle, and economic
            development. Calorie-dense diets and reduced physical activity are key
            contributors to these rising patterns.</p>

      <h2>Calorie Intake and Obesity Relationship (2022)</h2>

      <div class="scatter-container">
        <div class="scatter-text">
          <h3>Insights</h3>
          <p>There is a clear positive relationship between calorie supply and obesity rates.
          High-income regions such as Europe and the Americas cluster toward higher values,
          while low-income regions remain on the lower end of both calorie intake and obesity.</p>

          <p>This visualisation highlights how dietary energy availability is a major factor 
          behind regional differences in obesity prevalence. The regression line shows a 
          strong upward correlation between calorie consumption and obesity rates.</p>

          <p>
            In 2022, <strong>females</strong> had a higher average obesity rate globally 
            (around <strong>19.2%</strong>) compared to <strong>13.5%</strong> among males.
            This reflects both biological and lifestyle differences that influence 
            weight gain patterns worldwide.
